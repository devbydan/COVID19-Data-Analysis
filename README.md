<h1 align="center">Welcome to the COVID-19 Data Analysis application ðŸ‘‹</h1>

</p>

## Testing The Application

CDA requires [PSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) and a [JRE](https://www.java.com/en/download/) to run.

Clone the project [here](https://github.com/pseudodan/Covid-Data-Analysis.git) and enter its respective directory.

Install the dependencies prior to running the application.

Next, we need to start and create a PSQL instance.

```sh
$ cd postgresql
$ source startPostgreSQL.sh
$ source createPostgreSQL.sh
```

Now that the server instance is started and created, proceed to enter the ```java/src``` dir

```sh
$ cd java/src
$ source compile.sh
```

The application will now be running in your terminal with a text-based menu.
